TwitterBot
==========

A simple Twitter bot, in this case @TyrionBot, replying mentions to the fictional character with predefined quotes.

It was running on a Heroku app, using Sinatra and HerokuScheduler to do the one `get` request named `update` and reply as much tweets as possible, limited to five each 10 minutes.

Just a fun script to do and something to use as a reference in the future :)
